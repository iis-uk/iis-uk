	We are delighted to be returning to <a href="http://www.mollercentre.co.uk" title="The Møller Centre">The Møller Centre</a> again this year. The venue is approximately one mile from Junction 13 on the M11 motorway and a short taxi ride from Cambridge railway station with its frequent express services to Liverpool Street station and Stansted Airport.
